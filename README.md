# Clustering Dashboard

## Introduction
The Clustering Dashboard is a project designed to offer a platform for experimenting with and visualizing the clustering analysis process. The goal is to facilitate a swift and straightforward comprehension of this process for users.

## Features

### First Option: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this section, dashboards for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be developed. Especially, visualizations regarding city density using Python pique my interest. However, my fascination leans more towards visualizing machine learning and clustering processes, hence I plan to include this part at a later stage. It's a work in progress.

### Second Option: Clustering

#### Ver1 - K-means Clustering Playground:
In its inaugural version, the Machine Learning Playground introduces a k-means clustering playground where users can upload their own data, review initial data features, build k-means models with varying clusters, and visualize the output. The platform endows users with the flexibility to tweak various parameters such as the number of clusters, and to analyze the final output.

#### Ver2 - DBSCAN Clustering Playground:
Version 2 brings a new DBSCAN clustering playground to the fore. With DBSCAN, users are not required to specify the number of clusters beforehand; they only need to set two parameters: eps and min_samples. This simplifies the exploration and understanding of their data structure.
Additionally, a feature importance calculation has been introduced, utilizing a surrogate model decision tree. This enables users to better apprehend which features hold the most significance in their data and how they impact the performance of their models.

## Getting Started
The app has been deployed and can be accessed from [here](https://memretoktay.net/Blog%20Posts/dashboard.html).

Thank you for using the Machine Learning Playground!
