Welcome to my domain of data visualization using Python, powered by Plotly and Dash. This dashboard is designed to automate my customer clustering analysis. It's worth giving Dash a try. Essentially, in the clustering segment, I follow a structured process, subsequently developing an app to automate these steps. Moreover, this app provides the feature to export the clustered data back for further use. For more insights into this, feel free to explore this article: [Check this article](https://memretoktay.net/Blog%20Posts/plotly.html).

Please note that due to the resource constraints of the hosting platform, such as RAM and CPU limitations, there might be some initial lag in loading and processing times. However, if preferred, you can follow the outlined steps below to run the dashboard locally on your machine.

Moreover, owing to the substantial size of the datasets, I could only upload 10% slices of each; the full dataset exceeds the platform's RAM capacity, making the processing impractical. Here are the links to the original datasets: [Original Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset). As an alternate data option, I've also included the complete data file `creditcard.csv`. If you're feeling adventurous, give it a spinâ€”sometimes it works smoothly. And if you wish to upload your own dataset for analysis, please bear this information in mind.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Use the git command:
   \n```git clone https://github.com/EmreToktay/Clustering-Dashboard.git```\n
2. **Navigate to the Repository Folder:**
   - Once cloned, change to the directory using:
   \n```cd Clustering-Dashboard```\n
3. **Install Dependencies with the Requirements File:**
   - Install necessary libraries using:
   \n```pip install -r requirements.txt```\n
4. **Run the Application:**
   - With dependencies installed, run the application using:
   \n```python app.py```\n
5. **Access the Application Locally:**
   - After running `app.py`, open a web browser and navigate to:
   \n```http://127.0.0.1:8050/```\n
6. **Note:**
   - Ensure you have both pip and git installed on your machine before starting.
   - For best practices, consider using a virtual environment (venv or conda) to install the dependencies,
     which can help avoid potential conflicts with other Python projects.
